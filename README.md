# prime_generator

Its a simple functions to generate prime numbers. Since prime numbers are considered >1 , therefore the lowest prime number is 2.

ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS

at is_prime function : the isinstance loop have and if num <= 1 have log(0) respectively.
for loop have O(n^2) because of the range. its inner loop (if) has log(0)

at print_prime function:while loop has O(log(0)^n)
